# weather_app_js

## About

This is a project for the Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. See the full assignment details here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app 

This project uses a third party API, Open Weather API, to display weather data to the DOM when the user enters a query into the search bar.

I used Erik Flowers's weather icons because Open Weather's icons rendered too small. When enlarged, they became blurry. In addition, Erik Flowers's icons mapped to Open Weather API, which helped keep this part of my clode clean.

The app allows users to easily switch between celsius and fahrenheit as well.
